box2d-firemonkey
================

Firemonkey translation of open source 2D physics engine Box2D.

This branch implements a sailboat simulation using box2d-firemonkey.
for Win32, Win64 and iOS 

this is supposed to be a branch of firemonkey_box2d
however I had problems working on the branch,
so I made a new master

Compile TestBed_FM_Mobile.dproj
The sailboat is the 1st test.

I used Delphi 10.1 Berlin
